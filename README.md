### 📚 "The enemy of art is the absence of limitations." - Orson Welles

TL;DR of my thoughts on this quote: boundaries enable creativity, and creativity in software engineering is expressed in discovering and defining boundaries.

### ❓ Who is this guy?

To be honest, I'm still figuring that out 😄 there's so many titles and paths to explore. So far I've bushwacked 🌿 into web developer, software engineer, designer, writer, drummer. But even if I stick to those five, there's more than enough to keep me busy for a while.

### 💼 What I've worked on so far

- [speeches.byu.edu](https://speeches.byu.edu): Implemented and organized several page design & functionality rewrites. Facilitated optimization improvements which cut the overall site page speed in half (from average above 5 seconds to average below 2.5 seconds).
- [pg-core.byu.edu](https://pg-core.byu.edu): Built a central site theme framework used to standardize design & functionality across department websites.
- [brand.byu.edu](https://brand.byu.edu): As a summer project, rewrote the legacy codebase from scratch. The finished product supports the same feature set with a codebase 4% the size of the original.
- [uxd.byu.edu](https://uxd.byu.edu/): Designed and built the BYU UXD Association's website while serving as the Marketing Officer, 2020-2021.
- A personal website! Check it out [here.](http://calebayoung.com/)
