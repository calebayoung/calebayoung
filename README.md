## üìä Projects

### Role-Based Access Control
As our customer base grew, the existing out-of-the-box user account types no longer met all clients' needs. Admins struggled to allow user access following the principle of least privilege. This highlighted the need for a re-evaluation of our access management strategy. Defining permissions and roles, along with the ability to create custom roles assigned to any user, represented a significant shift in our platform and would require at least a year of planning and development.

After completing initial research, I led team discussions around project definitions, guiding principles, and concerns. After covering every issue we could think of (including possible solutions to each), I organized cross-team meetings with staff engineers. It took a lot of time up front, but we eventually covered every available concern and defined solutions for each.

The infrastructure and back-end for RBAC has been completed and is already in early access with our most engaged clients. Development of RBAC UI and UX will continue through 2024 and into 2025, enabling client self-service and enhancing internal access control.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)
The original implementation of SSO required engineers to configure the feature for each client, which quickly became unsustainable. In 2023, we initiated the development of a self-service SSO configuration experience. The challenge was to present SSO settings to clients in a simple and intuitive way. Our success metrics included SSO feature adoption and the reduction of SSO-related support requests, both of which exceeded expectations following the project‚Äôs release.

### SMS Registrations
Similar to the SSO project, SMS registration (for automated SMS notifications) initially relied on engineering assistance. To create a self-serve experience, we integrated with our SMS provider‚Äôs API and managed several moving pieces behind the scenes. The final product provided clear communication to clients regarding the status of their SMS registration and eliminated the need for engineer involvement.

### Billing Sync
Supported and maintained the syncing process between the mortgage platform and the company‚Äôs billing system, including transitioning to a new billing system instance following the nCino acquisition. Implemented changes to improve the visibility and reliability of the sync process. Collaborated closely with the Accounting department and assisted with audits to ensure data accuracy.
